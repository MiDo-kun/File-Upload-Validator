# File Upload Validator

## Project Overview

The File Upload Validator is a basic PHP application that validates files upon uploading. The project is created using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and PHP. It is to test and ensure that uploaded files meet certain criteria before they are accepted. This can help to prevent the upload of malicious files or files that are too large to handle in real world projects. The application uses regular expressions and built-in PHP functions to validate the file type and size.

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Gain a better understanding of how PHP works.
- Learn how regular expressions work and how to use them in PHP.
- Explore different built-in functions such as preg_match, preg-match_all, and preg_replace.

## Key Feature

Through this project, I gained the following knowledge and skills:

- Allows users to upload files and validates if the file is a 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', or 'pdf' and that it is not more than 40mb in size.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation PHP. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
